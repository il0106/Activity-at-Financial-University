# Activity at Financial University
These are the most interesting works during my university studing
## Control test
Work at my university. Task was to select some important features from dataset and fit log regression. Obviously, a timer was setted up, so don't laugh!)
Making use of:
1) dummy coding
2) train_test_split
3) RandomForestClassifier
4) SelectFromModel
5) RFE
6) LogisticRegression
## Essay on portfolio management
It was one of the most entertaining paper because mix of finance theory and python is always serendipity. 
I used these tricks:
1) apimoex package for parsing (it's incredibly convenient!)
2) some histograms and log transformations
3) many scatter plots
4) correlation tables
5) minimizing via SLSQP from scipy
6) finding solutions for system of equations via fsolve from scipy
7) colormaps
## Gradient busting with gen optimizing
This is my article for a magazine (https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/primenenie-geneticheskogo-algoritma-nastroyki-gradientnogo-bustinga-dlya-prognozirovaniya-izmeneniya-otkrytogo-interesa-po-dannym). The gist is hyperparameter optimization via genetic algorithms. 
Perfoming such tricks as:
1) GradientBoostingRegressor
2) building a python class for optimizing
3) genetic algorithm (Tournament with mutations, also I used the hall of fame)
4) checking the Himmelblau case
## Home control test
One of my control work at the university (yeep, again). Let's see what I used (task is inside the notebook):
1) values of correlation
2) descriptive statistics
3) scatter and histograms
4) DecisionTreeClassifier
5) SVM (particularly SVC)
## LSTM for predicting iRTS
